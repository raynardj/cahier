    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a thematic, card-based layout to present the 10 brain-boosting activities. The information is categorized into three intuitive groups: 'Body & Foundation', 'Mental Stimulation', and 'Emotional & Social Well-being'. This structure avoids a long, linear scroll and allows users to quickly navigate to areas of interest. The user flow is designed for discovery: users can explore activities by category or use a 'Benefit Filter' to find activities targeting specific goals (e.g., 'Improve Memory'). Clicking on an activity card reveals a detailed view with benefits, the science behind it, and practical tips. This interactive, non-linear approach was chosen to make the dense information from the report digestible, engaging, and personally relevant to the user, promoting exploration over passive reading. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: 10 brain-boosting activities and their benefits. -> Goal: Organize & Inform. -> Viz/Method: Interactive card grid (HTML/Tailwind/JS) with icons. -> Interaction: Click to expand details. -> Justification: Modern, scannable, and mobile-friendly way to present distinct topics. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation.
        - Report Info: MIND Diet recommendations (foods to encourage/limit). -> Goal: Compare & Inform. -> Viz/Method: Two horizontal bar charts (Chart.js). -> Interaction: Hover tooltips for details. -> Justification: Visually separates 'eat more' vs. 'eat less' and makes quantitative data easy to compare. -> Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Synergistic effects of activities on core cognitive domains. -> Goal: Show Relationships. -> Viz/Method: Radar chart (Chart.js). -> Interaction: Select an activity from a dropdown to dynamically update the chart. -> Justification: A radar chart is ideal for showing how a single activity impacts multiple metrics (Memory, Focus, etc.) simultaneously, reinforcing the holistic message. -> Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Activities linked to specific outcomes (e.g., stress reduction). -> Goal: Allow task-oriented exploration. -> Viz/Method: Filter buttons. -> Interaction: Click to highlight relevant activity cards. -> Justification: Empowers users to find solutions based on their personal needs, increasing engagement. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Your brain is not a static organ; it possesses a remarkable ability to change and adapt throughout your life—a phenomenon called **neuroplasticity**. This means you can actively improve your brain's functionality. The activities in this guide are not "quick fixes" but scientifically validated lifestyle choices that promote the formation of new neural connections, enhance cognitive skills like memory and focus, and build a resilient "cognitive reserve" against age-related decline.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">The goal is to move beyond a simple checklist and embrace a holistic approach. By integrating these practices, you create a powerful, synergistic effect that amplifies the benefits, leading to a sharper, more vibrant mind. This interactive tool is designed to help you explore these strategies, understand the science behind them, and find practical ways to incorporate them into your life.</p>
