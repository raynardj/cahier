    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Slate, Zinc) with a soft Amber accent. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a top navigation bar that controls which content section is visible. This modular, tab-like structure allows users to focus on one topic at a time (e.g., Definitions, Careers, Leaders) rather than being overwhelmed by a long-scrolling page. The flow is designed for non-linear exploration: a user can jump directly to the celebrity case studies if they wish, or systematically move from definitions to practical applications. This structure was chosen for its clarity, focus, and ability to house distinct interactive elements (like the career filter and the leader-specific radar charts) in self-contained, logical modules, enhancing usability over a simple text document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Core Concepts: Report text on definitions and qualities is presented in side-by-side animated panels for direct comparison. Accordion-style interactions are used to reveal details on demand, reducing initial cognitive load. Goal: Inform/Compare. Method: HTML/CSS/JS. 2. Career Paths: The report's list of jobs is converted into an interactive, filterable grid of cards. Goal: Organize/Guide. Interaction: Users click filters ('Upward', 'Downward', 'Balanced') to instantly see relevant roles. Justification: More engaging and user-directed than a static table. Method: HTML/CSS/JS. 3. Celebrity Leaders: The dense text analysis is synthesized into a dynamic profile view with a radar chart as the centerpiece. Goal: Compare/Analyze. Interaction: Selecting a leader updates the chart and text. Justification: The radar chart provides a powerful, at-a-glance comparison of complex leadership styles, which is more impactful than text alone. Library: Chart.js (Canvas). 4. Recommendations: Presented as clear checklists for easy consumption. Goal: Inform/Action. Method: HTML/CSS. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                        <p>Effective management within any organization requires navigating relationships both with superiors and with direct reports. This dual responsibility is captured by the concepts of <strong>upward management</strong> (influencing those above you) and <strong>downward management</strong> (leading those below you). These are not mutually exclusive skills; they are two sides of the same leadership coin.</p>
                        <p>This interactive guide delves into the qualities that define excellence in each direction, identifies careers where these skills are paramount, and examines real-world examples through the leadership styles of prominent figures. The goal is to understand that the most impactful leaders are not just good at giving orders or good at taking them—they are skilled at building alliances, fostering trust, and driving success across all levels of an organization. Use the navigation above to explore each facet of this essential leadership dynamic.</p>
